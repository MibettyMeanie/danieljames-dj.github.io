The learning can be classified into 4 for easier understanding: 1. Supervised Learning 2. Unsupervised Learning 3. Semi-supervised Learning 4. Reinforcement Learning",

The solution I would suggest is to host the websites in different ports (other than 80) and the Apache2 should be listening to port 80. From port 80, Apache2 will redirect to different websites depending on the domain name. Here are the complete steps:",
