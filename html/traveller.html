		<h1>a.k.a. Traveller.</h1>
		<p class="lead">I used to travel a lot to different places in the country (mainly for competitions) and sometimes outside the country too. But I'm a bad photographer/videographer/vlogger, because of which I don't have any proofs. Recently, I bought a GoPro and started taking videos of my travel. So I just like to share 'em to you guys.</p>
